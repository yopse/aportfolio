                  In essence, a CSS framework comprises several CSS stylesheets ready for use by web developers and designers. The stylesheets are prepared for use for standard web design functions: setting colors, layout, fonts, navbars, etc. Generally, stylesheets are supported and expanded by other scripting technologies like SASS and JavaScript.

With a CSS framework, the user has a completed CSS stylesheet, and they only have to code the HTML with accurate classes, structure, and IDs to set up a web page. The framework already has classes built-in for common website elements â€“ footer, slider, navigation bar, hamburger menu, column-based layouts, etc.
