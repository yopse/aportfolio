              JavaScript is the programming language that lets the Internet work. The Internet would be nothing without JavaScript.

              </p>

            

              <p>JavaScript, being the de-facto language of the Internet, is usually run from within an Internet browser. In fact, one can write all of the JavaScript  want and watch it run in real-time right in the browser by pressing F12 (for Windows), or Cmd+option+J (for Mac) (for Google Chrome). This will open up your console.
                While this is one way to run your JavaScript, most JavaScript is run from a file with the extension of .js (e.g., fileName.js) and loaded into your browser via the script tag in your HTML.</p>

              <p>Pen Notebook or register will be our best friends throughtout your journey take notes religiously.</p>
              
              <p>Learn by doing but just by doing first watch the tutorials properly and then take notes and make the things.</p>

                 <h2>Variables</h2>

              <p>
                At the heart of JavaScript are variables. A variable is a way to store the value of something to use later.
            
                
            </p>
         
         
            <h2>Math Operators</h2>
            <img src="img/bta.png" width="500px" alt="">

          <p>One of the first jobs a computer had was to compute numbers. In JavaScript, we have built-in math operators that work exactly as they do on your calculator.</p>
            <h2>+ — * / =</h2>
            
            <h2>% </h2>
            <img src="img/btb.png" alt="">
              <p>Something you may not have seen before is the Modulo (%). This math operator will divide the two numbers and return the remainder.</p>


            <p>You dont have to memorise every thing or tag  focus on understanding pattern and implementation of things.</p>
             
            
            <h2>Functions</h2>

            <img src="img/btc.png" alt="">

            <p>Functions allow us to perform many computations and return a final product. When we run a computer program, we are running a series of functions, and reading or manipulating what they return. </p>

            
            
             

            <p>A function will start with the function keyword. This tells whatever is running your program that what follows is a function and to treat it as such. After that comes the name of the function. We like to give functions names that describe what they do. Then comes open and close parentheses. And finally, open and close brackets. In between these brackets is where all of our function code will go.</p> 
               
            <img src="img/btd.png" alt="">

            <p>In this example, we declare a function logsHello and we set it up to console.log ‘hello’. We can then see that in order to run this function, we need to write its name followed by parentheses. This is the syntax to run a function. A function always needs parentheses to run.</p>
            <h2>Arguements</h2>
            <p>Now that we can run a basic function, we are going to start passing it arguments.</p>

            <img src="img/bte.png" alt="">
          
            <p>If we add a variable to the parentheses when we declare the function, we can use this variable within our function. We initiate the value of this variable by passing it into the function when we call it. So in this case, name = ‘Dan’. We can pass other variables into this as well:
            </p>

            <img src="img/btf.png" alt="">
            <p>We can add multiple arguments by placing a comma in between them:</p>

            <h2>Control Flow</h2>

            <p>Often times, as a computer is reading and executing our code, we want code to run only if something is true or not. This is known as control flow. Not all code on the screen is executed in order, or at all. We will learn to use some basic control flow today.

              In this example we are going to use control flow and comparison operators. Control flow is a way for our function to check to see if something is true, and either running the code supplied if it is, or moving on if it is not. For this we will use the if keyword:
              </p>
             <img src="img/btg.png" alt="">

             <p>Here we are taking a number (age) and checking to see if the statement is true. The statement 16 > 15 is true, so we will return true, and the function will stop. If it is not, it will skip that code and the function will return false.
              The “Greater Than” symbol ( > ) that you see in the last example is called a Comparison Operator. Comparison Operators evaluate two items and return either true or false.</p>
